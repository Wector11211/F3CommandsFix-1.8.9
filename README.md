This addon fixes an annoying issue in 1.8 version that relates to [F3 combinations](https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Debug_Screen#Commands).

For example, firing `F3+A` to realod chunks also moves you left (because of `A`) and keeps debug screen opened after that.

It's even more annoying when you need to reaload textures via `F3+T`, because both debug screen and chat remain opened after a command.
The addon fixes mentioned issues while a stanalone press of `F3` works as usual — it opens a debug screen.
